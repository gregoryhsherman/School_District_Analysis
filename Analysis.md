## School District Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to take the data from fifteen schools and break it down into easily understood metrics.

### Results

The district summary's overall passing value for Thomas High School is decreased.
The school summary's math and reading are drastically decreased, showing that most 9th graders are passing, reinforcing the disctrict summary.
Replacing the 9th graders data drastically impacted the school, moving it from the 2nd best to the 8th best

The math and reading scores are now NaN for Thomas High School in the 9th grade
There is no change to school spending since the students are still accounted for, just not their grades
There is a signifcant change to overall passing students in the mid range school size: 91% to 85%
There is a change to charter schools passing: 90% to 87%

The changes to the grades for Thomas High School seem to be incomplete - we have eliminated the grades but kept the student count.
I dont know what this could be applied to outside of determining the weight that a 9th grade class has on a school.
